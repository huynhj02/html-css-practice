    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPGs are good for photos.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg'/>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.gif'/>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams/icons, since they share the same colour abilities as JPGs and can be transparent.
      However, for a PNG to appear the same quality as a JPG, it will take up a much larger file size.

    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>

    <!--Interesting Note about SVGs: for text to be formatted how you want, you need to convert text to outlines-->
